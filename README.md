# TIE

TIE (short for "technical interview exercises") is a lightweight open-source
tool aimed at helping students quickly get ramped up on key concepts,
principles, and coding patterns that are important in software engineering.

The project is currently in a very early stage, and this README file will be
fleshed out more as development continues.

Note: This is not an official Google product.
